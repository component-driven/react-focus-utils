# react-focus-utils

![Release](https://github.com/component-driven/react-focus-utils/workflows/Release/badge.svg)

This package includes:

- `FocusWithin` component — the missing JS API of the CSS `:focus-within` for React
- `WithSelector` component to allow preview of pseudo-styles like `:hover` and `:focus` in styleguides
- `mixins` — a collection of mixins for pseudo styles (`:focus`, `:disabled`) to work with CSS-in-JS libraries
